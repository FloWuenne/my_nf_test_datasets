# my_nf_test_datasets
Collection of test datasets for nextflow pipeline during testing.

## molcart
Small test data from Molecular Cartography. Contains DAPI, WGA and RNA spot positions for two small crops of a cross-section of an infarcted mouse heart. SAMPLE2 is a 90 degree rotated copy of SAMPLE1. They should therefore have the same QC readouts but be visually distinguishable.
